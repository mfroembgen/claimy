# Claimy Helm chart

This chart deploys the Claimy HTTP service and its pre-install/pre-upgrade
Goose migration Job. It owns one Deployment, one ClusterIP Service, and one
runtime ConfigMap. When migrations are enabled, it also creates a pre-install
hook ConfigMap that remains until the next migration hook. MySQL, credentials,
ingress, TLS termination, NetworkPolicy, and other network resources remain
the responsibility of the operator.

The chart is named `claimy-chart`. The Docker image is `beeemt/claimy`; the
chart is published separately as the OCI artifact `beeemt/claimy-chart` so
chart versions never overwrite image tags.

## Required configuration

The chart intentionally has no usable identity-provider defaults. Configure
all required database and identity-provider settings:

- `database.host`, `database.port`, `database.name`, and `database.user`;
- `database.existingSecret` and `database.passwordKey`;
- `config.claimy.auth.team_domain`;
- `config.claimy.auth.rest`, `.gitlab`, and `.chat` issuer, audience, and
  `jwks_url` values; and
- `config.claimy.chat.app_identity`, `allowed_spaces`, and `deadline`.

The five fields sourced from Operations metadata may be left at their empty
defaults only when `extraEnv` provides the matching environment variable from
a required `secretKeyRef` or `configMapKeyRef`:

| Value field | Environment variable |
| --- | --- |
| `database.host` | `SQLC_DEFAULT_URI_HOST` |
| `config.claimy.auth.team_domain` | `CLAIMY_AUTH_TEAM_DOMAIN` |
| `config.claimy.auth.rest.audience` | `CLAIMY_AUTH_REST_AUDIENCE` |
| `config.claimy.chat.app_identity` | `CLAIMY_CHAT_APP_IDENTITY` |
| `config.claimy.chat.allowed_spaces` | `CLAIMY_CHAT_ALLOWED_SPACES` |

Each reference must have a non-empty `name` and `key`; `optional: true` is not
accepted. The chart validates the reference shape, not whether the Secret or
ConfigMap exists or contains valid runtime data. Claimy validates the fetched
values when it starts.

The `config` value uses Claimy's existing `config.dist.yml` shape. Configure
`config.claimy.auth.*` and `config.claimy.chat.*` in that map; do not create a
second top-level auth configuration. See the
[authentication guide](../../../docs/authentication.md) for provider setup and
accepted configuration fields. Browser CLI login is disabled by default at
`config.claimy.auth.cli.enabled: false`. Enable it only after supplying the
public client metadata required by Claimy.

The chart overlays the following fields in the shared runtime configuration:

- `httpserver.default.port` comes from `service.port` (8088 by default);
- `httpserver.default.timeout.drain` and `.timeout.shutdown` are fixed at
  5s and 60s, respectively, while `kernel.kill_timeout` is fixed at 70s;
- `sqlc.default.uri.host`, `port`, `user`, and `database` come from
  `database.*`;
- `sqlc.default.parameters` comes from `database.parameters`; the schema
  requires `loc: UTC`, `time_zone: "'+00:00'"`, and `parseTime: "true"` in
  values files; and
- `sqlc.default.migrations.enabled` is always `false` because the hook owns
  migrations.

The chart's `extraEnv` entries are passed, in order, to both the API
Deployment and migration Job after the database password Secret reference.
Gosoline applies those environment overrides to the loaded `config.dist.yml`
settings, including SQLC URI fields and existing query-parameter keys. Keep
the effective SQLC `loc`, `time_zone`, and `parseTime` values compatible with
Claimy's UTC sessions and native MySQL time scanning.

For example, `SQLC_DEFAULT_PARAMETERS_TIME_ZONE` overrides the existing
`time_zone` key. Supply the raw SQL string literal `'+00:00'`, including its
single quotes. SQLC's driver URL-escapes it when formatting the Goose
connection string, so do not pre-URL-encode it.

The database password is never put in a values file or ConfigMap. Both
containers read it from `CLAIMY_DATABASE_PASSWORD`; Claimy applies this raw
value after loading SQLC settings so brace characters are not interpolated.
The ordinary ConfigMap and the pre-install/pre-upgrade hook ConfigMap are
rendered by the same helper and use the same mounted path,
`/app/config.dist.yml`.

The migration Job runs `/app/claimy migrate`. That adapter reads the same
effective SQLC settings as the API, overlays the raw password, and asks the
pinned SQLC MySQL driver to format the DSN. Charset, collation, connection
timeouts, runtime query parameters, and special-character escaping therefore
come from the same settings rather than a chart-built DSN. The DSN is passed
only to the child Goose process through its environment, never as a process
argument; the adapter redacts the DSN and password from Goose output. No shell
is used.

## Create the database Secret

Create the Secret separately, before `helm install` or any upgrade that runs a
migration hook. Prefer a private file or stdin instead of placing the password
in shell history or a values file:

```sh
umask 077
printf '%s' "$CLAIMY_DB_PASSWORD" \
  | kubectl create secret generic claimy-db \
      --from-file=password=/dev/stdin
unset CLAIMY_DB_PASSWORD
```

Or write a file readable only by the current user and remove it after creation:

```sh
umask 077
printf '%s' "$CLAIMY_DB_PASSWORD" > claimy-db-password
kubectl create secret generic claimy-db \
  --from-file=password=./claimy-db-password
rm -f claimy-db-password
unset CLAIMY_DB_PASSWORD
```

Set `database.existingSecret: claimy-db` and
`database.passwordKey: password`. The Secret must exist in the same Kubernetes
namespace as the Helm release; pass `--namespace` consistently to Secret
creation and Helm commands. The chart does not create, update, or delete this
Secret. Changing it does not update running Pods by itself. If a
namespace-scoped Reloader is installed, use `deploymentAnnotations` to add its
Secret watch annotation; otherwise roll out/restart the Deployment after
password rotation.

For a namespace-scoped Stakater Reloader, place its watch annotation on the
Deployment metadata (not `podAnnotations`):

```yaml
deploymentAnnotations:
  secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "claimy-db,claimy-auth-metadata,claimy-cluster-connection"
```

## Install, upgrade, and rollback

Set a non-empty `image.tag` in the values supplied to every install or
upgrade. The source chart intentionally does not select a fake `0.0.0` image;
the selected image must be a built or published Claimy image that contains
both `/app/claimy` and `/app/goose`. For a stable Git tag `v1.2.3`, set
`image.tag: v1.2.3`; the corresponding OCI chart version is `1.2.3`
(without the leading `v`). The chart OCI artifact is available only after the
stable-tag image, package, and chart publication jobs all succeed.

From a checkout:

```sh
helm install claimy ./build/helm/claimy -f claimy-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 10m
helm upgrade claimy ./build/helm/claimy -f claimy-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 10m
helm rollback claimy 1 --wait --timeout 10m
```

From the published chart OCI repository:

```sh
helm install claimy \
  oci://registry-1.docker.io/beeemt/claimy-chart \
  --version 0.0.2 \
  -f claimy-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 10m
```

Pin `image.digest` or an immutable `image.tag` for production. The chart
version and OCI repository are independent from the `beeemt/claimy` image
repository. Helm rollback changes the workload and ConfigMap back to an older
release; it does **not** reverse SQL migrations already applied to MySQL.

The migration Job runs as a Helm `pre-install,pre-upgrade` hook using the same
runtime settings, environment, and Secret as the server. A pre-install hook
ConfigMap with weight `-10` makes the shared configuration available before
the Job (weight `-5`); that hook ConfigMap remains until the next pre-install
or pre-upgrade, when `before-hook-creation` replaces it. Successful hook Jobs
are deleted; failed Jobs are retained for diagnosis. A failed migration blocks
the install or upgrade and no new application rollout is considered successful.
Set `migrations.enabled: false` only when migrations are applied by a
separately controlled process.

Migrations can acquire MySQL metadata or table locks. Run only one install or
upgrade against a database at a time, and schedule schema-changing upgrades
when concurrent application deploys or other DDL are quiesced. The application
image must connect to MySQL 8.0.16 or newer. MariaDB is not supported, and the
Claimy schema requires InnoDB with the session time zone set to `+00:00`.

## Argo CD sync waves

By default, migrations use Helm pre-install/pre-upgrade hooks. Argo CD maps
these to `PreSync`, which runs before ordinary resources regardless of their
sync waves. If the same Application provisions the database and credential
Secrets, configure both migration resources as `Sync` hooks instead:

```yaml
migrations:
  configMapAnnotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: Sync
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "0"
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: Sync
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation,HookSucceeded
deploymentAnnotations:
  argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
```

Place database and credential resources from the enclosing deployment in
negative waves, with health checks that reflect actual readiness. Argo CD
then waits for those dependencies, creates configuration in wave 0, completes
migration in wave 1, and rolls out the API in wave 2. Keep the migration
ConfigMap until the next sync so it remains available while the Job runs.

`migrations.annotations` and `migrations.configMapAnnotations` extend or
override the default Helm annotations. Explicit Argo CD hook annotations take
precedence; use Argo annotations consistently for other hooks in the same
Application. Use a normal sync: hooks do not run in resource-selective syncs.
See [Argo CD phases and waves](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/)
and [Helm hook mapping](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/helm/#helm-hooks).

## Runtime health and capacity

The named Service and container port are `http` and default to 8088. The
Service is always `ClusterIP`; add an ingress, gateway, or external TLS edge
in the deployment environment if one is needed.

- `/health` is an unauthenticated liveness endpoint. It is suitable for
  deciding whether the HTTP process is alive and does not replace database
  readiness.
- `/ready` is an unauthenticated readiness endpoint. It performs a database
  `PingContext` bounded to two seconds, so a database outage removes the Pod
  from Service endpoints without pretending the application is ready.

The default container is non-root UID/GID 65532, uses a read-only root
filesystem, drops all Linux capabilities, disables privilege escalation, and
does not receive a service-account token. The default runtime configuration
allows five seconds to drain new traffic, 60 seconds to finish active HTTP
requests, and a 70-second kernel shutdown budget inside the 75-second Pod
termination grace period. Keep `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` at or above
75 seconds when changing those settings.

`resources`, node placement, tolerations, affinity, and topology spread are
ordinary Pod controls. SQL pools are **per replica**, not global: the default
`config.sqlc.default.max_open_connections` is 10 and
`max_idle_connections` is 2. Multiply the open-connection setting by the
maximum number of running replicas (and leave headroom for the migration and
other database clients) before choosing MySQL limits.

## IdP CA certificates and other mounts

The scratch image includes the normal system CA bundle. For an identity
provider using a private CA, use the conventional `extraVolumes`,
`extraVolumeMounts`, and `extraEnv` values. For example, mount a ConfigMap or
Secret containing a complete PEM bundle and point the Go TLS client at it:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: idp-ca
    secret:
      secretName: claimy-idp-ca
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: idp-ca
    mountPath: /etc/claimy/ca
    readOnly: true
extraEnv:
  - name: SSL_CERT_FILE
    value: /etc/claimy/ca/ca-certificates.crt
```

The same optional mounts are available to the migration Job. Do not place
passwords, OAuth client secrets, or bearer tokens in `config` or `extraEnv`.
